* **Direct Action and the Dublin Housing Crisis**
  In **Dublin, Ireland**, groups such as *Take Back the City* used occupations of vacant buildings and street protests to oppose rising rents, homelessness, and government inaction. A flashpoint occurred at **North Frederick Street**, where occupiers were forcibly removed by police and private bailiffs described as balaclava-clad heavies, triggering wider demonstrations over housing policy and the prioritization of property rights.

* **Anti-Migrant Violence in Pacaraima, Brazil (2018)**
  In **Pacaraima**, a Brazilian border town near Venezuela, local residents attacked camps of **Venezuelan migrants**, burning tents and belongings after a Brazilian shopkeeper was assaulted. Hundreds of migrants were driven back across the border. The violence reflected economic strain, fear of crime, and rising xenophobia tied to mass displacement from Venezuela.

* **Attack on the Nicaraguan Embassy in San José, Costa Rica (2010)**
  A **Molotov cocktail** was thrown at the **Nicaraguan Embassy in San José** amid heightened tensions over a border dispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua. No one was injured, but authorities warned against xenophobic violence toward Nicaraguan migrants and increased diplomatic security.

* **Earth Overshoot Day**
  An annual marker indicating the date when human consumption exceeds the Earth’s capacity to regenerate resources for that year, highlighting ecological overshoot, environmental debt, and unsustainable economic systems.

* **Recycling vs. Waste-to-Energy (Sweden)**
  **Sweden** has reported near-total waste recovery by counting energy generated from incinerating rubbish. Critics note this conflates material recycling with waste-to-energy, obscuring continued resource loss and emissions while presenting an inflated image of sustainability.

* **UK Institutional Failure and Public Tragedy**
  Major events revealing systemic failure include the **Hillsborough disaster** (Sheffield, 1989), where 97 football supporters died due to police mismanagement and later cover-ups, and the **Grenfell Tower fire** (London, 2017), which killed 72 residents due to flammable cladding, regulatory neglect, and ignored safety warnings.

* **Neoteny and Developmental Timing**
  A biological concept describing the retention of juvenile traits into adulthood due to slowed development. Related and contrasting terms include **paedomorphosis** (the broader category), **progenesis** (early sexual maturity), **peramorphosis**, **hypermorphosis**, and **developmental acceleration**.

* **Demons in Physics and Philosophy**
  Key thought experiments include **Maxwell’s Demon** (entropy and information), **Szilard’s Demon / Szilard Engine** (information has thermodynamic cost), **Laplace’s Demon** (classical determinism), **Loschmidt’s Paradox** (time reversibility vs. entropy increase), **Feynman’s Ratchet and Pawl** (false perpetual motion), **Wheeler’s Demon** (observation and quantum information), and the **Boltzmann Brain** (cosmological observer paradox).

* **Collective Authorship in Mathematics (Nicolas Bourbaki)**
  **Nicolas Bourbaki** was a collective pseudonym used by mostly French mathematicians beginning in the 1930s to rebuild mathematics on strict axiomatic and structural foundations. The project emphasized abstraction, rigor, and impersonality, reshaping modern algebra, topology, and analysis.

* **Traditionalist Catholic Critique of Pope Francis**
  Critics arguing that Pope Francis represents a rupture with Catholic tradition include **Carlo Maria Viganò**, who questions the legitimacy and moral authority of the current papacy; **Peter Kwasniewski**, who offers scholarly critiques focused on liturgy and doctrinal continuity; **Joseph Shaw**, a liturgical traditionalist; **Roberto de Mattei**, a Church historian; **Paolo Pasqualucci**, a philosopher critical of post-Vatican II theology; **Martin Mosebach**, a literary critic of modern liturgical reform; and **Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke**, who has publicly challenged aspects of Francis’s moral and sacramental teaching.

* **Hypnagogia**
  The transitional mental state between wakefulness and sleep, characterized by vivid imagery, drifting thoughts, altered perception, and loosened logic. It is often associated with creativity, hallucination, and dreamlike awareness.

* **Dream Technology and Speculative Cinema**
  Contemporary works explore technologies that interact with dreaming minds, raising ethical questions about surveillance, control, and commercialization of inner experience. Examples include **Saelyx Finna’s *Under the Dream***, which examines emerging neurotechnologies and dream research through speculative documentary cinema.

* **Independent and Festival Cinema**
  Films discussed such as *Invention* (Courtney Stephens) and *Sorry, Baby* (Eva Victor) emphasize grief, ambiguity, memory, and intimacy, often blending documentary elements with fiction and favoring restrained, character-driven storytelling.

* **Urban Wildlife as Symbol (Flaco the Owl)**
  **Flaco**, a Eurasian eagle-owl that escaped the Central Park Zoo in **New York City** in 2023, became a symbol of urban wildlife resilience and vulnerability. His death in 2024 after a building collision intensified debates about light pollution, glass buildings, and human responsibility toward animals in cities.

* **Flow and Human Fulfillment**
  Developed by **Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi**, flow describes a mental state of deep immersion where skill and challenge align, producing focus, creativity, and meaning. The concept has influenced psychology, education, work theory, and discussions of happiness.

* **Education as the “Conversation of Mankind”**
  **Michael Oakeshott** described education as entering an ongoing cultural conversation spanning history, philosophy, science, and art, emphasizing understanding, judgment, and tradition over technical utility.

* **Rock Escarpments**
  Long, steep geological formations created by erosion or faulting, where resistant rock layers form cliffs or ridges marking sharp elevation changes and natural boundaries in landscapes.
