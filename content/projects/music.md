## Ensemble of Peliatan Village – *Yama Sari*  

{{< youtube nb-DGF8zXMI >}}

**The Ensemble of Peliatan Village**, based in Bali, performs *Yama Sari* as a vibrant example of **Gamelan Gong Kebyar**, a modern Balinese music style known for its speed, complexity, and dramatic contrasts. Recorded for the JVC World Sounds series, this track captures the ensemble's precise coordination and expressive flair. The musicians play interlocking melodies on metallophones, gongs, and drums, producing a bright, shimmering texture that feels both communal and ceremonial.

The piece opens with sharp, syncopated strikes and cycles through bursts of motion and sudden pauses. Moments of gentler resonance are quickly interrupted by flourishes of rapid, percussive energy. Rather than following a steady build-up, *Yama Sari* moves in waves, reflecting the cyclical and episodic nature of Balinese performance. It is music intended not just to be heard but to animate temple festivals, dances, and processions. This recording offers listeners a vivid sense of Balinese sound aesthetics—layered, urgent, and deeply alive.

{{< youtube SYe-x9ZQF7o >}}

**Moheener Ghoraguli**, often considered India’s first experimental and independent rock band, emerged in 1970s Kolkata with a sound that defied conventions. They combined **Bengali lyrics**, **folk traditions**, and **Western musical influences** like jazz and psychedelic rock, creating a genre-bending style rooted in local identity and global awareness.

*Bhalobashi Jyotsnay Bhora Oi Phagun Raat* (“I Love That Moonlit Spring Night”) is a gentle, romantic ballad suffused with longing and poetic imagery. Its mellow instrumentation and dreamy vocals evoke the mood of a spring night shimmering with emotion. As the song unfolds, it becomes a quiet celebration of tenderness, memory, and the transience of beauty—an ode to both love and the fleeting nature of time.

**Moheener Ghoraguli** was a pioneering Bengali band from 1970s Kolkata that fused Western rock, jazz, and folk with Bengali poetry, social critique, and urban realism. Often seen as India’s first countercultural rock band, their music blended global forms with deeply local narratives, laying the foundation for what would later be known as “jibonmukhi gaan” (songs about real life).

*Bhebe Dekhecho Ki* (“Have You Ever Really Thought?”) is a reflective and gently provocative piece from their era-defining album *Prithibi Ta Naki Choto Hote Hote*. With plaintive vocals and a minimalist acoustic arrangement, the song meditates on emotional distance, self-deception, and the alienation of modern relationships. The repeated line “Tumi aar ami jai durey shorey” (“You and I keep drifting apart”) captures a quiet despair that feels universal. It’s music that doesn’t shout, but lingers—with questions more than answers.

Sung in Songhai, the piece pulses with repetitive guitar patterns and subtle melodic shifts, evoking the vast Sahelian landscapes of northern Mali. It’s a meditative journey through sound—both grounded in place and spiritually expansive.
