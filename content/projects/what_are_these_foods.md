* **Koginut Squash** is a modern hybrid winter squash bred from kabocha and butternut that combines deep, nutty, chestnut like flavor with a smooth, creamy texture and reliable cooking performance; its dense orange flesh caramelizes well when roasted, holds structure in soups and stews, and offers a richer, less watery alternative to butternut while remaining easier to prepare than traditional kabocha, making it popular with both chefs and home cooks.
