## What Was Pericles’ Strategy?

Pericles’ Strategy refers to the military and political plan adopted by the Athenian statesman Pericles at the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War in 431 BCE. Pericles, who lived from about 495 to 429 BCE, was one of Athens’ most influential leaders during its Golden Age. He understood that Athens and Sparta possessed fundamentally different strengths, so he designed a long term approach that would avoid Spartan advantages on land and maximize Athenian advantages at sea. In order to understand his strategy, it is necessary to define the basic geopolitical structure of Greece at this time. Athens led a maritime alliance known as the Delian League, composed of coastal cities and island states that contributed ships and money. Sparta led the Peloponnesian League, a land based alliance dominated by hoplite armies. A hoplite was a heavily armored infantry soldier who fought in a close formation known as the phalanx. Pericles believed that Athens could not win a direct land war against Sparta’s hoplites, who were considered the best infantry in Greece, but he also believed that Sparta could not compete with Athens’ powerful navy, its fortified port at Piraeus, and its long walls connecting Piraeus to the city. These long walls created a single defensible complex that protected Athens from siege even if its farmland was destroyed.

The central component of Pericles’ Strategy was a refusal to fight Sparta on land. When King Archidamus II of Sparta invaded Attica in 431 BCE, Pericles ordered the residents of the countryside to withdraw behind the city walls. This decision shocked many Athenians because it meant abandoning farms, orchards, and villages to destruction. However, Pericles defined victory not as the preservation of farmland but as the preservation of the city’s political and naval power. He argued that Athens could import grain and other goods by sea, maintain its fleet, and wait until Spartan resources were strained. Athens had a secure source of silver from the mines at Laurion, a strong navy funded by tribute from its allies, and the ability to conduct raids along the Peloponnesian coast. Pericles calculated that these advantages would eventually force Sparta to accept a negotiated peace.

A second component of his strategy was financial discipline. Pericles ordered Athens to conserve public money and avoid unnecessary military adventures. According to Thucydides, who lived from about 460 to 400 BCE and wrote the main historical account of the war, Pericles believed that Athens could endure as long as it avoided costly risks. He warned that the empire was a source of revenue that funded the navy and that the navy was the core of Athenian strength. Any policy that jeopardized the fleet would jeopardize the entire city.

A third component was psychological. Pericles understood that war required patience and unity. He delivered speeches urging Athenians to stay firm and not be provoked by Spartan invasions. In his Funeral Oration of 431 BCE, he framed the war as a test of the city’s greatness and argued that the values of democracy justified sacrifice. He attempted to shape public morale so that the population would endure hardship without abandoning the strategy.

The greatest challenge to Pericles’ Strategy came not from Sparta but from disease. In 430 BCE, a devastating plague struck Athens. The city was crowded because people from the countryside had taken refuge behind the walls. The plague killed somewhere between one quarter and one third of the population, including Pericles himself in 429 BCE. Without his leadership, Athens abandoned his cautious plan. Later leaders pursued aggressive and risky operations, the most famous being the Sicilian Expedition of 415 to 413 BCE, which ended in disaster. Thucydides argued that had Athens followed Pericles’ Strategy consistently, it might have outlasted Sparta and preserved its empire.

In summary, Pericles’ Strategy was a deliberate combination of defensive land tactics, offensive naval power, financial restraint, and moral leadership. It relied on the definition of victory as long term survival rather than short term territorial defense. It exploited Athens’ position as a maritime power and minimized exposure to Sparta’s superior infantry. Although the strategy was weakened by the unforeseen plague and later rejected by Athenian leaders, it remains one of the clearest examples in ancient history of a statesman designing a comprehensive military plan aligned with the strengths and weaknesses of his city.
