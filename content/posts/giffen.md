In economics, some goods behave in ways that contradict the basic law of demand, which states that when the price of a good increases, demand usually decreases. Two such exceptions are **Giffen goods** and **Veblen goods**, which display unusual demand patterns driven by unique factors.

A **Giffen good** is a type of **inferior good**, meaning that it is a good people tend to buy more of as their income decreases. However, unlike most goods, the demand for a Giffen good increases when its price rises. This happens because the price increase leads to a reduction in the consumer’s real income, making them feel poorer. As a result, they may end up buying more of the cheaper, staple good to maintain their calorie intake or basic needs. For example, imagine a poor population that mainly consumes **rice** or **bread**. If the price of rice rises, people may have less money to buy higher-quality foods, so they buy more rice, despite its higher price. This is a Giffen good at work. The key factor here is the **income effect**, the change in consumption that results from a perceived decrease in income, which outweighs the **substitution effect** (the tendency to switch to a cheaper alternative when prices rise). In this case, people can’t switch to another food because rice is a necessity and there are few substitutes. Giffen goods include rice (Hunan, China), wheat flour (Gansu, China), chapatis (India), millet or sorghum (Africa), and potatoes (Ireland, debated). There are no non-food examples, but could include fuel, housing, transportation or clothes. 

On the other hand, **Veblen goods** are goods for which demand increases as their price rises, but for a completely different reason. These goods are typically associated with **luxury** and **prestige**. People buy Veblen goods not just because they need them, but because they signal **wealth, status, and social standing**. A **luxury good**, such as a high-end **designer handbag** or an **expensive sports car**, is a classic example of a Veblen good. When the price of these goods goes up, they become even more desirable to consumers who are looking to show off their affluence. This phenomenon is called **conspicuous consumption**, where people purchase expensive items to display their wealth. In contrast to the Giffen good, Veblen goods are driven by **social signaling** rather than necessity. **Prestige pricing** is often used for such goods, where a high price is set specifically to make the product more desirable to those seeking status. For example, a limited-edition **wristwatch** from a prestigious brand may be bought at a high price because it is rare and signals that the owner is wealthy and sophisticated.

Both Giffen and Veblen goods defy the basic laws of supply and demand, but they do so for very different reasons. Giffen goods increase in demand when prices rise due to a **poverty-driven decision** to buy more of a cheap necessity. Veblen goods, however, are consumed more as their price increases because of the **desire to showcase status**. Examples of Giffen goods include basic foods like **rice** or **bread** in impoverished regions, while Veblen goods include luxury items like **designer clothes** or **sports cars**. Understanding these goods requires recognizing the role of **income** and **social factors** in shaping consumer behavior.
