### The Runner
>Young Amiro lives in poverty in an Iranian port city, working as a bottle collector, shoe shiner, and ice water seller. Despite the harshness of his environment, marked by intense heat, heavy competition, and the constant threat of theft, his life is brightened by the camaraderie of his friends and his dreams of flying planes or sailing away. In heat and surrounded by fire, Amiro and his friends organize a race to a melting block of ice, which he triumphantly wins.
The Runner is a deeply sad story about poverty and child labor, but equally uplifting, showcasing the transformative power of aspirations and hope.
Directed by Amir Naderi, the film was released in 1985 in Persian. 


### El Norte  
> Arturo Xuncax is a coffee picker in a Guatemalan village in the 1980s amid the [Guatemalan Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guatemalan_Civil_War), who dreams of providing his family with a better economic future in the United States. He shares these aspirations with his teenage son, Enrique. When Arturo attempts to organize a labor union, he is attacked by the military, resulting in his brutal execution and beheading. Enrique and his sister Rosa flee their village, for the United States.
> 
> They journey through Mexico, aided by a Coyote—a paid guide who helps migrants cross the border. To avoid deportation back to Guatemala, they pose as Mexicans when apprehended by the Border Patrol, ensuring they are sent only to a nearby Mexican town. Their journey continues with a violent robbery, followed by a crawl through a rat-infested sewer.
> 
> Upon arriving in the United States, Enrique and Rosa face the hardship of life as undocumented immigrants. They find work in menial jobs, such as cleaners and busboys. Rosa becomes ill and dies, leaving Enrique grief-stricken and questioning the cost of leaving his home.

The film is harrowing and, at times, gruesome, such as the scenes wit the father’s beheading and the siblings’ crawl through the rat-infested sewer. But, it’s tone is light enough to see through to the end. Directed by Gregory Nava, the film was released in 1983.
