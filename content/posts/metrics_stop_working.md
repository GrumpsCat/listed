**Goodhart’s Law** is a principle in social science and economics that states that when a measure is turned into a target, it stops functioning as a reliable measure. The idea is named after **Charles Goodhart**, who articulated it in 1975 while analyzing monetary policy in the United Kingdom. A *measure* is a numerical indicator intended to describe or approximate a complex reality, such as economic health, performance quality, or institutional success. A *target* is a metric tied to rewards, penalties, or policy goals. Goodhart’s insight was that once people know a metric is being used to control outcomes, they change their behavior to optimize the metric itself rather than the underlying goal it was meant to represent.

Originally, Goodhart’s Law emerged from economics, specifically monetary policy. Governments attempted to control inflation by targeting measures such as the money supply, meaning the total amount of money circulating in an economy. Once these measures became policy targets, banks and financial institutions adjusted their behavior to meet the numerical goals without necessarily improving economic stability. The statistical relationship between the measure and the real economy broke down. This demonstrated a broader concept known as *reflexivity*, where measurement influences the system being measured, creating feedback loops that distort outcomes.

A well known modern example comes from academic publishing and the use of the *journal impact factor*. The impact factor is a metric that measures the average number of citations received by articles in a journal. It was originally designed as a rough indicator of journal influence. Once universities, funding agencies, and hiring committees began using impact factors as targets for evaluation, journals and researchers adapted their behavior. Editors favored articles likely to generate citations, researchers focused on trendy topics, and citation practices became strategic rather than scholarly. As a result, the impact factor became less effective at measuring genuine research quality, illustrating Goodhart’s Law in practice.

Similar distortions appear in healthcare metrics. For example, hospitals are often evaluated based on *length of stay*, which measures how long patients remain hospitalized. The goal is efficiency and cost control. When length of stay becomes a target, hospitals may discharge patients prematurely to improve their numbers. This can lead to higher readmission rates, worse health outcomes, and increased long term costs. The metric improves on paper, but the real objective, patient health, is undermined. This reflects the broader concept of *metric fixation*, where excessive emphasis on numerical indicators replaces judgment and qualitative assessment.

Goodhart’s Law also applies in education and public policy. Standardized test scores are meant to measure student learning, but when schools are rewarded or punished based on test results, teaching often narrows to test preparation rather than deeper understanding. In public administration, targets for crime reduction or inspections can encourage underreporting or superficial compliance rather than genuine improvement. In each case, the measure becomes a surrogate for the goal, a process known as *surrogation*, where the indicator replaces the reality it was intended to track.

The broader significance of Goodhart’s Law is that it exposes a fundamental tension in modern systems of accountability. Measurement is necessary for coordination and evaluation, but when metrics are treated as definitive representations of complex human activities, they invite manipulation and unintended consequences. Goodhart’s Law does not argue against measurement itself, but against naive reliance on single metrics as tools of control. Its lesson is that effective evaluation requires multiple measures, contextual judgment, and constant awareness that numbers change behavior as much as they describe it.
