The Ellsberg Paradox is a well-known thought experiment in decision theory and behavioral economics that reveals how people often make choices that contradict the predictions of classical rational decision-making. Introduced by Daniel Ellsberg in 1961, the paradox shows that individuals tend to prefer options with known risks over those with unknown risks, even when the expected outcomes are similar. This tendency is called ambiguity aversion, a reluctance to choose options when the probability of outcomes is unclear. The paradox challenges the traditional expected utility theory, which assumes that people make decisions by comparing the expected value of different outcomes using consistent, logical preferences.

To understand the paradox, consider this example: Imagine a box containing 90 balls. You are told that 30 of them are red. The other 60 are a mix of black and yellow, but you do not know how many of each. Now you are asked to choose between two bets. 

* Bet A gives you $100 if a red ball is drawn
* Bet B gives you $100 if a black ball is drawn
  
Most people choose Bet A because they know exactly how many red balls there are, while the number of black balls is uncertain. Now imagine a second choice. Bet C gives you $100 if the ball is red or yellow. Bet D gives you $100 if the ball is black or yellow. Most people now choose Bet D. But this creates a contradiction. If you thought black balls were less likely than red in the first choice, then you should prefer Bet C in the second. Instead, people switch their preference, which shows inconsistent reasoning. This behavior cannot be explained by expected utility theory, which assumes that people make consistent choices based on probabilities. The paradox shows that people are uncomfortable with not knowing the chances, even when the outcomes might be similar.

The Ellsberg Paradox highlights that human decision-making is not only about weighing outcomes, but also about how much confidence we have in the information available. In real-world situations, people often avoid uncertain choices even when they might lead to better results. For example, an investor might choose a savings account with a known interest rate over a new business venture with a higher but uncertain return. This preference for known risks over unknown ones can lead to overly cautious decisions. In response to this paradox, economists and psychologists have developed alternative models, such as maxmin expected utility and prospect theory, which take ambiguity and human psychology into account.

In the end, the Ellsberg Paradox reveals that classical models of rationality do not fully describe how people actually behave. When faced with uncertainty, most people prefer clarity over ambiguity, even if it means passing up better opportunities. This insight has shaped modern theories of economics, finance, and decision science by showing that real human behavior often depends not just on outcomes, but on the confidence we have in the probabilities themselves.
