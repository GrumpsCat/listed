{{< youtube OgNFwXC4I6M >}}

**Ali Farka Touré** (1939–2006) was a legendary Malian guitarist, singer, and multi-instrumentalist known for blending **traditional Malian music** with the tonalities of **American blues**. His work helped global audiences recognize the African roots of the blues and highlighted the richness of West African musical traditions.

*Heygana*, from his posthumous album *Savane* (2006), is a haunting, rhythmic track steeped in the desert blues style Touré helped define. Sung in Songhai, the piece pulses with repetitive guitar patterns and subtle melodic shifts, evoking the vast Sahelian landscapes of northern Mali. It’s a meditative journey through sound—both grounded in place and spiritually expansive.
