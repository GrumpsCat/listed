**Gulistān, KSS 63** (1926) is one of Sorabji’s intricate piano pieces, inspired by the Persian poet Sa’di’s Gulistān (The Rose Garden). The work is notable for its lush harmonies, ornate textures, and virtuosic demands, reflecting Sorabji’s fascination with Persian culture and his innovative approach to piano composition.

**Rued Langgaard** (1893–1952) was a Danish composer known for his visionary and mystical music, blending late Romanticism with modernist elements. Largely unrecognized during his lifetime, his works gained appreciation posthumously for their originality and innovation.
**Symphony No. 9, "From Queen Dagmar’s City"** is one of Langgaard’s later works, composed in 1942. It is a grand, expressive symphony with a nationalistic tone, inspired by Danish history and culture. Featuring dramatic contrasts and lyrical passages, it reflects Langgaard’s unique musical style and deep emotional intensity.
