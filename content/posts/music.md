**Rued Langgaard** (1893–1952) was a Danish composer known for his visionary and mystical music, blending late Romanticism with modernist elements. Largely unrecognized during his lifetime, his works gained appreciation posthumously for their originality and innovation.

**Symphony No. 9, "From Queen Dagmar’s City"** is one of Langgaard’s later works, composed in 1942. It is a grand, expressive symphony with a nationalistic tone, inspired by Danish history and culture. Featuring dramatic contrasts and lyrical passages, it reflects Langgaard’s unique musical style and deep emotional intensity.
