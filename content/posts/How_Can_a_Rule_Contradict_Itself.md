A catch 22 is a self contradictory rule, requirement, or situation in which the conditions for escape or success cancel each other out. The term was introduced by Joseph Heller in his 1961 novel Catch 22, which follows a group of American bomber pilots during the Second World War. In the story, absurd and circular regulations control every aspect of military life. A catch 22 creates a closed logical loop. If a person follows one rule, it violates another. If a person tries to satisfy a condition, the attempt itself makes the condition impossible to meet. Heller uses these structures to show how institutions can trap individuals in systems that defy reason or fairness.

The most famous example in the book is the rule defining insanity and flight duty. A pilot may be excused from flying dangerous missions if he is insane. However, he must request the exemption. The act of requesting exemption proves that he is sane, because only a sane person would want to stay alive. Therefore he must fly the missions. If he does not request exemption, he continues to fly. Either choice leads to the same result. This is the core of the catch 22. Another example appears when Yossarian tries to avoid flying by claiming illness. The doctors cannot prove he is healthy, but they also cannot prove he is sick. His ambiguity is used against him, and he returns to combat. The character Doc Daneeka faces a different circular rule when he is declared dead by military paperwork after being listed on a flight that crashed. Although he is physically alive, the record states he is dead, and because the record is official, no one can treat him as a living person. Bureaucratic truth replaces physical truth. Colonel Cathcart creates another trap by constantly raising the required number of missions for each airman. Whenever a soldier reaches the quota and expects to go home, the target number is raised again. The rule is always shifting and therefore never satisfied. The regulation that binds Major Major is another circular structure. He orders that no one may see him unless he is not in his office. If he is present, visitors must be turned away. If he is not present, they may enter, but he is not there to meet them. These examples show how circular reasoning can be used as a form of control.

Real world catch 22 situations appear when institutions create conditions that negate each other. A common example is the requirement that job seekers must have experience in order to be hired, but they must first be hired in order to gain experience. Citizens who need housing may be required to show proof of residence, which they cannot do because they have no housing. Immigrants may need legal status in order to work, but they need work in order to gain legal status. Students may need financial aid to enroll, but must already be enrolled to qualify for financial aid. In each case, the rule blocks its own fulfillment. Public policy can also contain circular requirements. A person may need identification to obtain a government document, but that document is needed to obtain identification. These loops appear benign on the surface but become traps when the rules are applied rigidly.

Philosophical catch 22 like problems involve self defeating conditions or circular demands placed on knowledge, morality, or existence. One example is the classic verification challenge in epistemology. A person may be told to trust only beliefs that can be justified, yet the method of justification requires trusting some belief in advance. Another example is seen in debates about free will and determinism. If all actions are determined, moral responsibility appears meaningless. If moral responsibility is required for society to function, then society must act as if people have free will even when philosophical arguments deny it. In ethics, a person might be required to act out of pure moral duty, yet the awareness of being observed or judged contaminates the purity of the motive. These philosophical loops mirror the logic of a catch 22 because the conditions undermine one another.

A catch 22 is not simply a contradiction. It is a system in which the structure of the rule itself blocks any path forward. Heller used it to critique bureaucracy, war, and the power of institutions to trap individuals through logic that appears orderly but is fundamentally irrational. The expression is now part of common language because many modern systems still create situations in which the rules make compliance unreachable. Catch 22 is a reminder that logic, procedure, and authority can be arranged in ways that deny fairness and prevent escape, creating a world in which doing the correct thing and doing the required thing become impossible at the same time.
