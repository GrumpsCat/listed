## CPU

Intel Core i5-12600KF - Core i5 12th Gen Alder Lake 10-Core (6P+4E) 3.7 GHz LGA 1700 125W Desktop Processor - BX8071512600KF

* Intel 7 Alder Lake Processor Base Power: 125W
    * Processor Base Power refers to the power consumption of the processor when operating at its base frequency. For this Intel Alder Lake processor, it consumes 125 watts of power at its base operational state.
* Maximum Turbo Power: 150W 
* 20MB L3 Cache 
    * L3 Cache is a type of memory on the processor used to store frequently accessed data to speed up processing. Having 20MB of L3 Cache means the processor can store a substantial amount of data close to the cores, which improves efficiency and performance.
* 9.5MB L2 Cache 
    * L2 Cache is another type of cache memory, smaller and faster than L3 Cache, but larger and slower than L1 Cache. This processor has 9.5MB of L2 Cache, which helps to further speed up data access for the cores.
* None Integrated Graphics

Intel Core i7-14700K - Core i7 14th Gen 20-Core (8P+12E) LGA 1700 125W Intel UHD Graphics 770 Processor - Boxed - BX8071514700K

* 20 cores (8 P-cores + 12 E-cores) and 28 threads. Integrated Intel UHD Graphics 770 included
* Performance hybrid architecture integrates two core microarchitectures, prioritizing and distributing workloads to optimize performance
* Up to 5.6 GHz unlocked. 33MB Cache
* Compatible with Intel 600-series (with potential BIOS update) and 700-series chipset-based motherboards
* Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0 Frequency, and PCIe 5.0 & 4.0 support. DDR4 and DDR5 Memory support.
* Cooling device not included - Processor Only
