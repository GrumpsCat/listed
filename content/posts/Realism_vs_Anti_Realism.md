# The Positive Argument Against Scientific Realism

The passage discusses significant philosophical arguments concerning scientific realism and anti-realism, particularly focusing on quantum physics. Here are the key points and arguments:

1. **Putnam's No Miracles Argument (1975)**:
   - **Positive Argument for Realism**: Hilary Putnam coined the "no miracles argument," which suggests that the success of science is best explained by the truth (or approximate truth) of its theories. This is a positive argument supporting scientific realism.
   - **Pessimistic Meta-Induction (1978)**: Conversely, Putnam also presented a negative argument suggesting that because many successful scientific theories of the past have been proven false, current successful theories are likely to be false as well. This is known as the pessimistic meta-induction.


>*Hilary Whitehall Putnam  (July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, computer scientist, and figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He contributed to the studies of philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem.(Wikipedia)*


2. **Constructive Empiricism (van Fraassen, 1980)**:
   - **Observable vs. Unobservable Distinction**: Bas van Fraassen's constructive empiricism posits that science aims not at true theories but at theories that are empirically adequate. A key element of this view is the distinction between observables (which can be directly observed) and unobservables (which cannot).
   - **Vagueness of Observability**: Critics, like Maxwell (1962), argue that the line between observation and theory is arbitrary and lacks clear criteria, challenging the foundational basis of van Fraassen's distinction.

   > Grover Maxwell (1918–81) noted that the concept of the observable varies with the range of available devices.

3. **Quantum Physics and Anti-Realism**:
   - **Quantum Physics as a Challenge to Realism**: The success of quantum physics (QP) might suggest that scientific realism is not an appropriate philosophical stance. This idea stems from the fact that quantum mechanics does not rely on classical realistic presuppositions and has led to reconsiderations of the nature of scientific explanation and observation.
   - **Van Fraassen’s Influence**: Van Fraassen has been influenced by quantum theory in shaping his anti-realist stance, arguing that QP challenges the idea that physics must explain how appearances are produced in reality.


>*Bastiaan Cornelis van Fraassen (born 1941) is a Dutch-American philosopher noted for his contributions to philosophy of science, epistemology and formal logic. He is best known for his work on free logic and his introduction of the supervaluation semantics*


4. **Argument from Quantum Physics Against Realism**:
   - The passage suggests that there is an implicit argument against scientific realism based on the success of quantum physics, though it has not been explicitly stated or defended in the philosophical literature. This argument could show that because quantum mechanics does not adhere to realistic presuppositions yet remains highly successful, the case for realism is weakened.
   - **Wallace's Distinction (2020)**: It is important to distinguish between "quantum theory" as a formal framework and "quantum physics" as its concrete applications. The argument against realism is more nuanced than simply denying the existence of atoms; it concerns the deeper implications of how our most predictive theories work without relying on realism.

>*David Wallace is a contemporary philosopher who is interested in the Everett interpretation of quantum theory (often called the "Many-Worlds Interpretation"), quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, general relativity, symmetry and gauge theory.*

The text outlines the background and context for an argument that uses the success of quantum physics to challenge scientific realism. It highlights the nuanced debate between realism and anti-realism, particularly how quantum mechanics complicates traditional realist interpretations of scientific theories.

# Epistemic Reductionism and the Moral- Epistemic Disparity


### 1. Ethical Confidence and Moral Properties

- **Ethical Claims**: The author expresses confidence in certain ethical claims. These include judgments that some actions are not acceptable (morally wrong) and that some situations are good in themselves (intrinsically good).
- **Moral Properties**: The author believes in the existence of properties like being morally wrong or being intrinsically good.

### 2. Reductionism in Metaethics

- **Reductionism**: This is the view that moral facts and properties are identical to facts and properties from another domain, and can be described using non-moral language.
- **Natural Facts**: Most reductionist theories in ethics reduce moral facts to natural (empirical) facts, often psychological ones. For example, Hume suggested that calling something vicious means feeling blame towards it due to our nature.
- **Examples**: The theory that being intrinsically good is just being a state of pleasure is a form of reductive naturalism.

### 3. Non-Naturalism in Ethics

- **Non-Naturalists**: They argue that moral properties are unique and cannot be reduced to natural or descriptive properties. Each moral property is distinct and not another type of property.
- **Necessary Connections**: Non-naturalists acknowledge necessary connections between moral and non-moral facts but see them as two distinct phenomena.
- **Example**: Some non-naturalists are hedonists who believe that something is intrinsically good because it is a state of pleasure, but they see this as two separate phenomena rather than a single one with two descriptions.

### 4. Moral Realism vs. Anti-Realism

- **Moral Realism**: This is the belief that there are moral facts and that some moral properties are stance-independent (they do not depend on people's attitudes or practices).
- **Stance-Independent**: A property is stance-independent if it doesn't rely on observers' attitudes or practices.
- **Examples**: The Humean view (stance-dependent) contrasts with hedonism (stance-independent). Hedonism is a form of moral realism because it posits that some states of pleasure are intrinsically good, regardless of observers’ attitudes.
- **Robust Moral Realism**: This refers to non-naturalist moral realism, which is a form of moral realism that does not reduce moral properties to natural properties.

### 5. Analogous Categories in Metaepistemology

- **Epistemic Properties**: Just as there are moral properties (e.g., morally wrong), there are epistemic properties (e.g., having a reason to believe something, a belief being justified or reasonable).
- **Reduction and Independence**: The same questions about reduction and stance-independence apply to epistemic properties as to moral properties.
- **Moral Scepticism vs. Epistemic Scepticism**: People might doubt the existence of moral facts more often than epistemic facts (like the reasonableness of beliefs). The clear existence of epistemic facts can help argue for the existence of moral facts.

### Summary

The text explores the nature of moral properties and their potential reduction to natural properties, comparing reductionist and non-reductionist views. It discusses moral realism, where moral facts exist independently of human attitudes, and draws parallels with similar debates in metaepistemology about the nature of epistemic properties.

By understanding these distinctions and theories, you can better appreciate the debates in metaethics about the nature of moral properties and their relationship to natural facts.


# The Moral Open Question Argument

## Introduction
- Moral properties and facts resist analysis in terms of natural or non-moral facts and properties.
- The belief in this resistance is based on open-question-type considerations.
- The Open Question Argument (OQA) has been widely discussed and critiqued over time.

## Reductive Naturalism
- **Reductive naturalism**: Identifies normative/evaluative properties with natural properties.
- Two forms of reductive naturalism:
  - **Analytic reductionism**: Identity claim is analytic.
  - **Synthetic reductionism**: Identity claim is synthetic.
- The OQA challenges analytic reductionism.

## Analytic Reductionism and Open Questions
- In analytic reductionism, a natural property is identified with an ethical property.
- It will always be an “open question” whether things with the natural property also have the evaluative property.
- Example: Hedonism posits that all states of pleasure are intrinsically good.
  - A philosopher might argue that malicious pleasures have no intrinsic value.
  - This disagreement does not indicate a conceptual confusion but a difference in beliefs about intrinsic value.
  
## Metaethical Implications
- If intrinsic goodness and being a state of pleasure are necessarily coextensive, it does not resolve the open question.
- Therefore, intrinsic goodness cannot be analytically reduced to being a state of pleasure.

## Broader Implications
- The same reasoning applies to other natural or non-evaluative concepts and intrinsic goodness.
- Conflicting evaluative judgments do not indicate conceptual confusion or different topics but different beliefs.

## Objections to the Argument
- Some argue that the OQA can refute reductive analyses of any concept.
- Obvious reductions (e.g., unclehood):
  - To be an uncle: a male with a sibling who has an offspring.
  - Disagreement (offspring must be male) indicates conceptual confusion, not an open question.
- Non-obvious reductions (e.g., bachelorhood):
  - Simple view: all unmarried men are bachelors.
  - Disagreement (pope as bachelor) also indicates conceptual confusion.

## Comparing Disagreements
- Disagreements about intrinsic value (hedonism) are normal and do not indicate conceptual confusion.
- Disagreements about bachelorhood indicate different concepts and meanings.
- The OQA effectively challenges analytic reductionism in ethics but not in cases like bachelorhood or unclehood.

## Conclusion
- Committed reductionists might argue that their opponents misunderstand the concept.
- The plausibility of this stance depends on evaluation.
- The OQA casts doubt on analytic reductionism in ethics but not in other cases like unclehood or bachelorhood.



# The Epistemic Open Question Argument

## Introduction
- In epistemology, unlike ethics, the Open Question Argument (OQA) against analytic reductionism is not compelling.
- The failure of the OQA in epistemology suggests we should accept analytic epistemic reductionism, even without a definitive reductive analysis of epistemic notions.

## Sample Analysis of Epistemic Reasons
- Consider a sample analysis: a claim is reasonable to believe if it is likely to be true, given the subject’s evidence.
- Example: Sally sees wet streets and believes it likely rained. Intuitively, this belief is reasonable based on her evidence.

## Testing the Analysis
- Suppose the analysis is extensionally adequate (no counterexamples).
- The metaepistemological question remains: are being reasonable to believe and being probable relative to evidence the same condition under different labels?
- Use the OQA to test this: does conflicting belief indicate conceptual confusion or merely different beliefs?

## Application of Open Question Reasoning
- Suppose Sally agrees her evidence makes it likely it rained but denies it’s reasonable to believe so.
- This claim sounds incoherent, like she doesn't understand what she is saying.
- Unlike Moore-paradoxical claims ("that claim is true, but I don’t believe it"), Sally’s claim lacks coherence.

## Prudential vs. Epistemic Reasonability
- Pascal’s wager: “given all our evidence, theism is unlikely to be true, but it is reasonable to believe it is true.”
- Pascalian claims are coherent when "reasonable" is interpreted prudentially.
- Defenders of the epistemic OQA need claims like "given all our evidence, theism is unlikely, but it is epistemically reasonable to believe it" to be coherent, which they are not.

## Conclusion
- The epistemic OQA is not convincing, unlike the moral OQA.
- Therefore, analytic reductionism in epistemology is plausible and offers theoretical advantages.
- This poses a challenge for those using moral-epistemic parity to support robust moral realism, as epistemic normativity is not irreducible like moral normativity.






## Section 4: What If the Proposed Analysis of Epistemic Reasonability Is Not Extensionally Adequate?
### Chris Heathwood

1. **Metaethics and Reductionism:**
   - **Reductionism vs. Non-Reductionism:** Reductionism posits that moral facts and properties can be reduced to non-moral, often naturalistic, facts and properties. Non-reductionists argue that moral properties are irreducible and unique.
    >One example of moral facts and properties that can be reduced to non-moral, often naturalistic, facts and properties is the concept of altruism. Altruism is often understood as the selfless concern for the well-being of others. From a reductionist perspective, altruistic behavior can be explained in terms of evolutionary biology and psychology.
   - **Analytic Reductionism:** Focuses on the linguistic and conceptual aspects, asserting that moral properties can be analytically reduced to non-moral terms.
   - **The Open Question Argument:** Challenges analytic reductionism by highlighting that reducing moral properties to natural properties doesn't capture the full meaning of moral terms. The argument suggests that asking whether a natural property implies a moral property always remains an open question, indicating a gap in reductionist theories.
    >For example, if someone claims that goodness is identical to a particular natural property, such as pleasure or happiness, it is still possible to intelligibly ask whether something that possesses that natural property is truly good.


2. **The Epistemic Open Question Argument:**
   - **Analogous Argument:** Like in metaethics, there's a debate about whether epistemic properties (e.g., reasons, justification) can be reduced to non-normative terms.
   - **Sample Analysis:** Examines a potential reduction of epistemic properties to non-normative terms. For instance, defining reasonableness as the likelihood of a claim being true given evidence.
   - **Challenging the Argument:** Contrary to the moral OQA, the epistemic OQA isn't as compelling. The text presents a scenario where someone denies a claim's reasonableness despite acknowledging its likelihood of truth, suggesting conceptual confusion.
    >Sally looking out her window and seeing that the streets are wet. Based on her prior background beliefs and this new piece of information, it is very likely that it recently rained, but not reasonable. 
   - **Interpretive Challenge:** Some attempts to make the denial coherent involve redefining "reasonable" in non-epistemic terms, akin to prudential reasoning.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The epistemic OQA fails to strongly challenge analytic reductionism in epistemology, unlike its moral counterpart.
   - This opens the door to accepting analytic reductionism in epistemology, even though it may disappoint those who sought moral-epistemic parity to support robust moral realism.

# Realism and Anti-Realism in Pyrrhonism


**Author:** Otávio Bueno
=======
# Between Realism and Anti-Realism



**Abstract:** Bueno examines whether Pyrrhonists can adopt realist or anti-realist positions in science, arguing that understanding these as philosophical stances reconciles Pyrrhonism with them. He discusses voluntarism in Pyrrhonism and its implications.

The paper "Between Realism and Anti-Realism" by Marion Vorms, found in *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences*, explores various aspects of the debate between realism and anti-realism in the context of scientific theories and models. Here are some examples used in the paper:



**Introduction:** Pyrrhonism is presented as a method of investigation, involving suspending judgment rather than asserting truth or impossibility of knowledge.

- **Theories and Models:** Vorms discusses how different scientific theories and models can be interpreted through the lenses of realism and anti-realism. Realists argue that theories and models describe real entities and phenomena, while anti-realists view them as useful tools for predicting observations without necessarily describing reality.



**Voluntarism in Pyrrhonism:** The ability to control theoretical beliefs while perceptual beliefs remain involuntary.

- **The Case of Neptune:** An example often discussed in the context of scientific realism is the prediction and subsequent discovery of Neptune. Scientists predicted the existence of Neptune based on irregularities in Uranus's orbit, and its discovery supported the realist claim that scientific theories can describe unobserved entities.



**Conclusion:** Bueno suggests Pyrrhonism can accommodate both realist and anti-realist views within its framework, emphasizing the importance of philosophical stances.

- **Theoretical Entities:** Vorms examines how theoretical entities like electrons or quarks are treated within realism and anti-realism. Realists claim these entities exist independently of our observations, whereas anti-realists might argue they are merely useful constructs for explaining and predicting phenomena.



Bueno discusses Gödel's ideas challenging voluntarism and Pyrrhonists' approach to suspending judgment as a form of voluntary agnosticism. Pyrrhonists suspend judgment on philosophical and scientific views, seeking truth through an investigative stance.

Pyrrhonists neither commit to nor reject scientific realism, structural realism, or semirealism, but seek truth beyond appearances, aligning with realism as an investigative stance. The concept of stance is discussed, highlighting mode of engagement, style of reasoning, and propositional attitudes.

Pyrrhonists can engage with anti-realist views dialectically, questioning commitments while exploring alternatives, maintaining coherence by treating stances as modes of engagement. Understanding scientific practice dynamically allows them to navigate between realist and anti-realist perspectives without wholesale acceptance.

- **The Success of Science:** The "No-miracles" argument is presented, which posits that the success of scientific theories in making accurate predictions would be miraculous if these theories did not accurately describe some aspect of reality. This argument supports scientific realism.

- **Dark Matter:** The discussion includes the example of dark matter, which has not been directly observed but is posited to exist based on gravitational effects that cannot be explained by known matter. This case highlights the debate about whether theoretical entities proposed by scientific theories should be considered real.

These examples illustrate the practical implications of the realism vs. anti-realism debate, particularly how it affects our interpretation of scientific theories and their components.

## Scientific Realism, Metaphysical Antirealism and the No Miracle Arguments

Alai, M. Scientific Realism, Metaphysical Antirealism and the No Miracle Arguments. Found Sci 28, 377–400 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10699-020-09691-z

### Scientific Realism (SR) and Metaphysical Realism (MR)

**Scientific Realism (SR)** and **Metaphysical Realism (MR)** are two philosophical positions that often intersect but can also be distinguished. Understanding their relationship involves exploring whether one implies the other and whether they can exist independently.

#### Definitions

1. **Scientific Realism (SR):**
   - **SR** posits that the entities postulated by scientific theories (including unobservable entities) genuinely exist, and that scientific theories are (approximately) true descriptions of the world.
   - It involves a commitment to the truth of scientific theories and the existence of theoretical entities posited by these theories.

2. **Metaphysical Realism (MR):**
   - **MR** asserts that there is a mind-independent world that exists regardless of our perceptions, beliefs, or conceptual schemes.
   - It posits that truths about the world correspond to this mind-independent reality.

#### Logical Relationships Between SR and MR

##### (a) Does SR imply MR?

While SR often includes a commitment to MR (i.e., the existence of theoretical entities mind-independently), it does not necessarily imply MR. One can argue for the success and utility of scientific theories without making strong metaphysical claims about the mind-independent existence of the entities those theories posit. In other words, SR can be defended without a full commitment to MR.

##### (b) Is MR necessary to defend SR?

MR is not strictly necessary to defend SR. One can consistently hold SR without committing to MR, through positions like internal realism or metaphysical antirealism (MAR).

#### Scientific Realism without Metaphysical Realism

One can hold **SR** without **MR** through positions like:

1. **Internal Realism (IR):**
   - Proposed by Hilary Putnam, **IR** suggests that the truth of a statement depends on its coherence within a conceptual scheme or framework, not on a mind-independent reality.
   - This allows for a commitment to the success and truth of scientific theories without positing an independent reality.

2. **Metaphysical Antirealism (MAR):**
   - **MAR** denies the existence of a mind-independent reality but can still affirm the reliability and utility of scientific theories within human conceptual frameworks.

#### Putnam's Internal Realism and Scientific Realism

Hilary Putnam argued for a form of **SR** coupled with **MAR**, suggesting that the success of scientific theories can be understood without assuming a mind-independent world. Instead, theories are true in the sense that they are coherent and reliable within our conceptual schemes.

#### The "No Miracle" Argument (NMA) and Metaphysical Realism

The **No Miracle Argument (NMA)** is a key argument for SR, suggesting that the success of science would be miraculous if scientific theories were not at least approximately true descriptions of the world. Critics argue that the NMA also supports MR, as the best explanation for the success of science involves a mind-independent reality that corresponds to our theories.

1. **NMA and MR:**
   - The NMA suggests that MR provides the most plausible explanation for the success of scientific theories.
   - Denying MR while accepting the NMA could weaken the argument for SR.

#### Conclusion: SR, MR, and Their Compatibility

While SR and MR are logically distinct, and one can argue for SR without MR (through IR or MAR), the NMA implies a strong connection between SR and MR. The NMA suggests that the best explanation for the success of scientific theories involves a commitment to MR. Therefore, MR is not superfluous for SR but rather reinforces it without additional argumentative costs. Thus, while SR can be theoretically defended without MR, doing so may undermine the strongest argument for SR, the NMA.

### Historical Context and Philosophical Precedents

Historically, various philosophers have explored the relationship between reality, perception, and scientific theories:

1. **Berkeley's Idealism:**
   - Denied the mind-independence of objects but affirmed their existence within perception.

2. **Kant's Transcendental Idealism:**
   - Denied access to things-in-themselves but affirmed the objective reality of phenomena within human experience.

3. **Logical Positivists (Carnap, Schlick):**
   - Rejected metaphysical claims but supported the empirical adequacy and coherence of scientific theories.

Putnam and other philosophers have shown that various forms of realism (scientific, empirical, internal) can be logically consistent with metaphysical antirealism, emphasizing the flexibility and nuanced nature of these philosophical positions.

Two Different Kinds of Realist Claims: Ontologic and Semantic
2.1 Ontologic Claims

Ontologic realism concerns the nature of existence and properties of a target X. Here are various forms of ontologic realist claims:

OR1: X exists. This is the fundamental claim that something exists rather than not existing.
OR2: X is irreducible to something else. This means X is a fundamental constituent of reality and cannot be reduced to another form, such as physical objects not being reducible to ideas, or mental states not being reducible to brain states.
OR3: X exists objectively. This claim posits that X exists independently of perception, thought, or knowledge (mind-independent existence). For example, physical objects exist regardless of whether they are perceived.
OR4: X has properties, or relations, or a certain nature. This claim asserts that X possesses certain attributes or characteristics.
OR5: X’s properties are irreducible. This means the properties of X cannot be reduced to other types of properties, such as biological properties not being reducible to chemical or physical properties.
OR6: X’s properties are objective. This suggests that the properties of X exist independently of measurement or observation.
These claims build on each other: OR1 is entailed by OR2–OR6, and OR4 is entailed by OR5 and OR6. Conversely, the negation of each of OR1–OR6 represents ontologic antirealism.

2.2 Semantic Claims

Semantic realism pertains to whether language can truly refer to a target X. Semantic claims examine the ability of words and sentences to refer to their apparent referents, not just to some surrogate or verification condition. Here are key points about semantic claims:

Internal Reference: This trivial sense of reference, such as 'cow' referring to cows, is widely accepted. This form of internal semantic realism does not entail metaphysical realism.
Semantic MR (Metaphysical Realism): This form of realism holds that our words and sentences refer to actual entities or states of affairs (e.g., cows, electrons) as they appear, not merely to verification conditions or sensations.
Verificationism: This antirealist position posits that the meaning of statements is tied to their conditions of verification rather than to actual states of affairs. There are three main types of verificationism:
Phenomenist Verificationism: Sentences refer to sensations.
Reductionist Verificationism: Sentences refer to observable states of things.
Assertibility Verificationism: Sentences are true if they can be correctly asserted within the conventions of a linguistic community.
Verificationism reduces the meaning of statements to conditions that fall short of truth in the classical sense, making ontologic claims inexpressible in their intended form.

Summary
Ontologic realism focuses on the existence and properties of entities independently of our perceptions or knowledge. It posits that entities like physical objects and mental states have an objective, irreducible existence and properties. Semantic realism deals with the capability of language to refer to actual entities and their properties, opposing verificationist views that tie meaning to conditions of verification rather than to actual states of affairs. Together, these two types of realist claims form a comprehensive view of reality, asserting both the independent existence of entities and the ability of language to accurately describe them.


## Two Different Kinds of Realist Claims: Ontologic and Semantic

### 2.1 Ontologic Claims

Ontologic realism concerns the nature of existence and properties of a target X. Here are various forms of ontologic realist claims:

1. **OR1: X exists.**

4. **OR4: X has properties, or relations, or a certain nature.**
   - This claim asserts that X possesses certain attributes or characteristics.

5. **OR5: X’s properties are irreducible.**
   - This means the properties of X cannot be reduced to other types of properties, such as biological properties not being reducible to chemical or physical properties.

6. **OR6: X’s properties are objective.**
   - This suggests that the properties of X exist independently of measurement or observation.

These claims build on each other: OR1 is entailed by OR2–OR6, and OR4 is entailed by OR5 and OR6. Conversely, the negation of each of OR1–OR6 represents ontologic antirealism.

3. **Verificationism:** 
   - This antirealist position posits that the meaning of statements is tied to their conditions of verification rather than to actual states of affairs. There are three main types of verificationism:
     - **Phenomenist Verificationism:** Sentences refer to sensations.
     - **Reductionist Verificationism:** Sentences refer to observable states of things.
     - **Assertibility Verificationism:** Sentences are true if they can be correctly asserted within the conventions of a linguistic community.

Verificationism reduces the meaning of statements to conditions that fall short of truth in the classical sense, making ontologic claims inexpressible in their intended form.

## 3 Scientific Realism and Ontologic or Semantic Metaphysical Antirealism

### Phenomenism and Metaphysical Antirealism

**Berkeley, an advocate of metaphysical antirealism, denied that ordinary observable objects and properties exist mind-independently. However, he accepted that they exist in a mind-dependent way as sets of actual or possible sensations. This view is known as "phenomenism" about ordinary observable objects and properties.**

The question arises whether a similar stance can be taken with unobservable entities. Can one hold that the physical world is mind-dependent (ontologic metaphysical antirealism) while accepting the existence of unobservable entities as sets of actual or possible sensations? This seems problematic since unobservable entities cannot be directly sensed.

### Combining Ontologic Scientific Realism with Semantic Metaphysical Antirealism

An alternative approach is to combine the existence and objectivity of unobservable entities (**ontologic scientific realism**) with **semantic metaphysical antirealism**. This method aligns with how neopositivists treated observable objects. They accepted statements like "unobservable entities exist" and "unobservable entities exist objectively and mind-independently" but interpreted them verificationistically. Essentially, they asserted the obtaining of verification conditions for those sentences, such as certain sets of actual or possible sensations or observable states of things, or certain assertibility conditions.

### Addressing Objections and Counterfactuals

A potential objection is that this approach might seem like positivism or instrumentalism, reducing unobservable entities to sets of actual or possible sensations or assertibility conditions. However, this is only seen as a form of semantic antirealism from a metaphysical realist perspective. For verificationists, the objection loses its force as they view meaning through verification conditions.

Verificationists could argue that claims about unobservable entities are confirmed by numerous possible experiments and observations, not just a single set of actual or possible sensations. Thus, meaning encompasses many sets of actual or possible sensations or observable states, which are not reducible to their individual members.

However, verificationists face the challenge of accounting for modalities and counterfactuals. Counterfactual claims need categorical truthmakers, often mind-independent and irreducible unobservable entities. For example, the statement "there are charged particles in this apparatus" implies that certain experiments would yield specific results. The truth of this counterfactual relies on the actual existence of those particles.

### Neopositivist Response to Counterfactuals

Neopositivists might respond that possible and necessary conditions are determined by empirically confirmed laws. Thus, statements about unobservable entities are grounded in these laws. Critics might argue that empirical laws are merely descriptions of past sensations or observations. However, verificationists can counter that laws are confirmed by complex sets of sensations or observations, maintaining a weak form of realism about unobservable entities.

### Verificationism and Meaning

Carnap and Hempel highlighted significant concerns about verificationism. Carnap noted that no amount of claims about actual or possible sensations can exhaust the meaning of claims about ordinary observable objects and properties, and Hempel showed that discourse about unobservable entities is not reducible to observable states. These concerns challenge the idea that meaning consists solely of verification or confirmation conditions. Despite this, the compatibility of verificationist metaphysical antirealism and ontologic scientific realism remains an open debate.

### Idealist and Abstract Entity Perspectives

Another possible combination of scientific realism and metaphysical antirealism involves idealism. An idealist might argue that the world exists only in thought (like Hegel) or that only abstract entities exist (like Plato). In the first case, unobservable entities could exist as models created by scientists' minds (Popper's "World 2"). In the second, they could exist in the realm of abstract entities (Popper's "World 3"). Although this might be considered a weak acceptance of unobservable entities, it still represents a form of scientific realism if the models are seen as robust and stable constructions supported by well-confirmed theories.

### Conclusion

**Certain instances of ontologic scientific realism can be consistently combined with certain forms of metaphysical antirealism. These combinations show that it is possible to maintain scientific realism while adopting metaphysical antirealism. However, scientific realists might find it challenging to defend this position without accepting some form of metaphysical realism.**
