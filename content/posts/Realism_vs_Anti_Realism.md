# The Positive Argument Against Scientific Realism

The passage discusses significant philosophical arguments concerning scientific realism and anti-realism, particularly focusing on quantum physics. Here are the key points and arguments:

1. **Putnam's No Miracles Argument (1975)**:
   - **Positive Argument for Realism**: Hilary Putnam coined the "no miracles argument," which suggests that the success of science is best explained by the truth (or approximate truth) of its theories. This is a positive argument supporting scientific realism.
   - **Pessimistic Meta-Induction (1978)**: Conversely, Putnam also presented a negative argument suggesting that because many successful scientific theories of the past have been proven false, current successful theories are likely to be false as well. This is known as the pessimistic meta-induction.


>*Hilary Whitehall Putnam  (July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, computer scientist, and figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He contributed to the studies of philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem.(Wikipedia)*


2. **Constructive Empiricism (van Fraassen, 1980)**:
   - **Observable vs. Unobservable Distinction**: Bas van Fraassen's constructive empiricism posits that science aims not at true theories but at theories that are empirically adequate. A key element of this view is the distinction between observables (which can be directly observed) and unobservables (which cannot).
   - **Vagueness of Observability**: Critics, like Maxwell (1962), argue that the line between observation and theory is arbitrary and lacks clear criteria, challenging the foundational basis of van Fraassen's distinction.

   > Grover Maxwell (1918–81) noted that the concept of the observable varies with the range of available devices.

3. **Quantum Physics and Anti-Realism**:
   - **Quantum Physics as a Challenge to Realism**: The success of quantum physics (QP) might suggest that scientific realism is not an appropriate philosophical stance. This idea stems from the fact that quantum mechanics does not rely on classical realistic presuppositions and has led to reconsiderations of the nature of scientific explanation and observation.
   - **Van Fraassen’s Influence**: Van Fraassen has been influenced by quantum theory in shaping his anti-realist stance, arguing that QP challenges the idea that physics must explain how appearances are produced in reality.


>*Bastiaan Cornelis van Fraassen (born 1941) is a Dutch-American philosopher noted for his contributions to philosophy of science, epistemology and formal logic. He is best known for his work on free logic and his introduction of the supervaluation semantics*


4. **Argument from Quantum Physics Against Realism**:
   - The passage suggests that there is an implicit argument against scientific realism based on the success of quantum physics, though it has not been explicitly stated or defended in the philosophical literature. This argument could show that because quantum mechanics does not adhere to realistic presuppositions yet remains highly successful, the case for realism is weakened.
   - **Wallace's Distinction (2020)**: It is important to distinguish between "quantum theory" as a formal framework and "quantum physics" as its concrete applications. The argument against realism is more nuanced than simply denying the existence of atoms; it concerns the deeper implications of how our most predictive theories work without relying on realism.

>*David Wallace is a contemporary philosopher who is interested in the Everett interpretation of quantum theory (often called the "Many-Worlds Interpretation"), quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, general relativity, symmetry and gauge theory.*

The text outlines the background and context for an argument that uses the success of quantum physics to challenge scientific realism. It highlights the nuanced debate between realism and anti-realism, particularly how quantum mechanics complicates traditional realist interpretations of scientific theories.

# Epistemic Reductionism and the Moral- Epistemic Disparity
## Section 4: What If the Proposed Analysis of Epistemic Reasonability Is Not Extensionally Adequate?
### Chris Heathwood

1. **Metaethics and Reductionism:**
   - **Reductionism vs. Non-Reductionism:** Reductionism posits that moral facts and properties can be reduced to non-moral, often naturalistic, facts and properties. Non-reductionists argue that moral properties are irreducible and unique.
    >One example of moral facts and properties that can be reduced to non-moral, often naturalistic, facts and properties is the concept of altruism. Altruism is often understood as the selfless concern for the well-being of others. From a reductionist perspective, altruistic behavior can be explained in terms of evolutionary biology and psychology.
   - **Analytic Reductionism:** Focuses on the linguistic and conceptual aspects, asserting that moral properties can be analytically reduced to non-moral terms.
   - **The Open Question Argument:** Challenges analytic reductionism by highlighting that reducing moral properties to natural properties doesn't capture the full meaning of moral terms. The argument suggests that asking whether a natural property implies a moral property always remains an open question, indicating a gap in reductionist theories.
    >For example, if someone claims that goodness is identical to a particular natural property, such as pleasure or happiness, it is still possible to intelligibly ask whether something that possesses that natural property is truly good.


2. **The Epistemic Open Question Argument:**
   - **Analogous Argument:** Like in metaethics, there's a debate about whether epistemic properties (e.g., reasons, justification) can be reduced to non-normative terms.
   - **Sample Analysis:** Examines a potential reduction of epistemic properties to non-normative terms. For instance, defining reasonableness as the likelihood of a claim being true given evidence.
   - **Challenging the Argument:** Contrary to the moral OQA, the epistemic OQA isn't as compelling. The text presents a scenario where someone denies a claim's reasonableness despite acknowledging its likelihood of truth, suggesting conceptual confusion.
    >Sally looking out her window and seeing that the streets are wet. Based on her prior background beliefs and this new piece of information, it is very likely that it recently rained, but not reasonable. 
   - **Interpretive Challenge:** Some attempts to make the denial coherent involve redefining "reasonable" in non-epistemic terms, akin to prudential reasoning.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The epistemic OQA fails to strongly challenge analytic reductionism in epistemology, unlike its moral counterpart.
   - This opens the door to accepting analytic reductionism in epistemology, even though it may disappoint those who sought moral-epistemic parity to support robust moral realism.
