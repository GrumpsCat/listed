# The Positive Argument Against Scientific Realism

The passage discusses significant philosophical arguments concerning scientific realism and anti-realism, particularly focusing on quantum physics. Here are the key points and arguments:

1. **Putnam's No Miracles Argument (1975)**:
   - **Positive Argument for Realism**: Hilary Putnam coined the "no miracles argument," which suggests that the success of science is best explained by the truth (or approximate truth) of its theories. This is a positive argument supporting scientific realism.
   - **Pessimistic Meta-Induction (1978)**: Conversely, Putnam also presented a negative argument suggesting that because many successful scientific theories of the past have been proven false, current successful theories are likely to be false as well. This is known as the pessimistic meta-induction.


>*Hilary Whitehall Putnam  (July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, computer scientist, and figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He contributed to the studies of philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science. Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem.(Wikipedia)*


2. **Constructive Empiricism (van Fraassen, 1980)**:
   - **Observable vs. Unobservable Distinction**: Bas van Fraassen's constructive empiricism posits that science aims not at true theories but at theories that are empirically adequate. A key element of this view is the distinction between observables (which can be directly observed) and unobservables (which cannot).
   - **Vagueness of Observability**: Critics, like Maxwell (1962), argue that the line between observation and theory is arbitrary and lacks clear criteria, challenging the foundational basis of van Fraassen's distinction.

   > Grover Maxwell (1918–81) noted that the concept of the observable varies with the range of available devices.

3. **Quantum Physics and Anti-Realism**:
   - **Quantum Physics as a Challenge to Realism**: The success of quantum physics (QP) might suggest that scientific realism is not an appropriate philosophical stance. This idea stems from the fact that quantum mechanics does not rely on classical realistic presuppositions and has led to reconsiderations of the nature of scientific explanation and observation.
   - **Van Fraassen’s Influence**: Van Fraassen has been influenced by quantum theory in shaping his anti-realist stance, arguing that QP challenges the idea that physics must explain how appearances are produced in reality.


>*Bastiaan Cornelis van Fraassen (born 1941) is a Dutch-American philosopher noted for his contributions to philosophy of science, epistemology and formal logic. He is best known for his work on free logic and his introduction of the supervaluation semantics*


4. **Argument from Quantum Physics Against Realism**:
   - The passage suggests that there is an implicit argument against scientific realism based on the success of quantum physics, though it has not been explicitly stated or defended in the philosophical literature. This argument could show that because quantum mechanics does not adhere to realistic presuppositions yet remains highly successful, the case for realism is weakened.
   - **Wallace's Distinction (2020)**: It is important to distinguish between "quantum theory" as a formal framework and "quantum physics" as its concrete applications. The argument against realism is more nuanced than simply denying the existence of atoms; it concerns the deeper implications of how our most predictive theories work without relying on realism.

>*David Wallace is a contemporary philosopher who is interested in the Everett interpretation of quantum theory (often called the "Many-Worlds Interpretation"), quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, general relativity, symmetry and gauge theory.*

The text outlines the background and context for an argument that uses the success of quantum physics to challenge scientific realism. It highlights the nuanced debate between realism and anti-realism, particularly how quantum mechanics complicates traditional realist interpretations of scientific theories.

# Epistemic Reductionism and the Moral- Epistemic Disparity


### 1. Ethical Confidence and Moral Properties

- **Ethical Claims**: The author expresses confidence in certain ethical claims. These include judgments that some actions are not acceptable (morally wrong) and that some situations are good in themselves (intrinsically good).
- **Moral Properties**: The author believes in the existence of properties like being morally wrong or being intrinsically good.

### 2. Reductionism in Metaethics

- **Reductionism**: This is the view that moral facts and properties are identical to facts and properties from another domain, and can be described using non-moral language.
- **Natural Facts**: Most reductionist theories in ethics reduce moral facts to natural (empirical) facts, often psychological ones. For example, Hume suggested that calling something vicious means feeling blame towards it due to our nature.
- **Examples**: The theory that being intrinsically good is just being a state of pleasure is a form of reductive naturalism.

### 3. Non-Naturalism in Ethics

- **Non-Naturalists**: They argue that moral properties are unique and cannot be reduced to natural or descriptive properties. Each moral property is distinct and not another type of property.
- **Necessary Connections**: Non-naturalists acknowledge necessary connections between moral and non-moral facts but see them as two distinct phenomena.
- **Example**: Some non-naturalists are hedonists who believe that something is intrinsically good because it is a state of pleasure, but they see this as two separate phenomena rather than a single one with two descriptions.

### 4. Moral Realism vs. Anti-Realism

- **Moral Realism**: This is the belief that there are moral facts and that some moral properties are stance-independent (they do not depend on people's attitudes or practices).
- **Stance-Independent**: A property is stance-independent if it doesn't rely on observers' attitudes or practices.
- **Examples**: The Humean view (stance-dependent) contrasts with hedonism (stance-independent). Hedonism is a form of moral realism because it posits that some states of pleasure are intrinsically good, regardless of observers’ attitudes.
- **Robust Moral Realism**: This refers to non-naturalist moral realism, which is a form of moral realism that does not reduce moral properties to natural properties.

### 5. Analogous Categories in Metaepistemology

- **Epistemic Properties**: Just as there are moral properties (e.g., morally wrong), there are epistemic properties (e.g., having a reason to believe something, a belief being justified or reasonable).
- **Reduction and Independence**: The same questions about reduction and stance-independence apply to epistemic properties as to moral properties.
- **Moral Scepticism vs. Epistemic Scepticism**: People might doubt the existence of moral facts more often than epistemic facts (like the reasonableness of beliefs). The clear existence of epistemic facts can help argue for the existence of moral facts.

### Summary

The text explores the nature of moral properties and their potential reduction to natural properties, comparing reductionist and non-reductionist views. It discusses moral realism, where moral facts exist independently of human attitudes, and draws parallels with similar debates in metaepistemology about the nature of epistemic properties.

By understanding these distinctions and theories, you can better appreciate the debates in metaethics about the nature of moral properties and their relationship to natural facts.


# The Moral Open Question Argument

## Introduction
- Moral properties and facts resist analysis in terms of natural or non-moral facts and properties.
- The belief in this resistance is based on open-question-type considerations.
- The Open Question Argument (OQA) has been widely discussed and critiqued over time.

## Reductive Naturalism
- **Reductive naturalism**: Identifies normative/evaluative properties with natural properties.
- Two forms of reductive naturalism:
  - **Analytic reductionism**: Identity claim is analytic.
  - **Synthetic reductionism**: Identity claim is synthetic.
- The OQA challenges analytic reductionism.

## Analytic Reductionism and Open Questions
- In analytic reductionism, a natural property is identified with an ethical property.
- It will always be an “open question” whether things with the natural property also have the evaluative property.
- Example: Hedonism posits that all states of pleasure are intrinsically good.
  - A philosopher might argue that malicious pleasures have no intrinsic value.
  - This disagreement does not indicate a conceptual confusion but a difference in beliefs about intrinsic value.
  
## Metaethical Implications
- If intrinsic goodness and being a state of pleasure are necessarily coextensive, it does not resolve the open question.
- Therefore, intrinsic goodness cannot be analytically reduced to being a state of pleasure.

## Broader Implications
- The same reasoning applies to other natural or non-evaluative concepts and intrinsic goodness.
- Conflicting evaluative judgments do not indicate conceptual confusion or different topics but different beliefs.

## Objections to the Argument
- Some argue that the OQA can refute reductive analyses of any concept.
- Obvious reductions (e.g., unclehood):
  - To be an uncle: a male with a sibling who has an offspring.
  - Disagreement (offspring must be male) indicates conceptual confusion, not an open question.
- Non-obvious reductions (e.g., bachelorhood):
  - Simple view: all unmarried men are bachelors.
  - Disagreement (pope as bachelor) also indicates conceptual confusion.

## Comparing Disagreements
- Disagreements about intrinsic value (hedonism) are normal and do not indicate conceptual confusion.
- Disagreements about bachelorhood indicate different concepts and meanings.
- The OQA effectively challenges analytic reductionism in ethics but not in cases like bachelorhood or unclehood.

## Conclusion
- Committed reductionists might argue that their opponents misunderstand the concept.
- The plausibility of this stance depends on evaluation.
- The OQA casts doubt on analytic reductionism in ethics but not in other cases like unclehood or bachelorhood.



# The Epistemic Open Question Argument

## Introduction
- In epistemology, unlike ethics, the Open Question Argument (OQA) against analytic reductionism is not compelling.
- The failure of the OQA in epistemology suggests we should accept analytic epistemic reductionism, even without a definitive reductive analysis of epistemic notions.

## Sample Analysis of Epistemic Reasons
- Consider a sample analysis: a claim is reasonable to believe if it is likely to be true, given the subject’s evidence.
- Example: Sally sees wet streets and believes it likely rained. Intuitively, this belief is reasonable based on her evidence.

## Testing the Analysis
- Suppose the analysis is extensionally adequate (no counterexamples).
- The metaepistemological question remains: are being reasonable to believe and being probable relative to evidence the same condition under different labels?
- Use the OQA to test this: does conflicting belief indicate conceptual confusion or merely different beliefs?

## Application of Open Question Reasoning
- Suppose Sally agrees her evidence makes it likely it rained but denies it’s reasonable to believe so.
- This claim sounds incoherent, like she doesn't understand what she is saying.
- Unlike Moore-paradoxical claims ("that claim is true, but I don’t believe it"), Sally’s claim lacks coherence.

## Prudential vs. Epistemic Reasonability
- Pascal’s wager: “given all our evidence, theism is unlikely to be true, but it is reasonable to believe it is true.”
- Pascalian claims are coherent when "reasonable" is interpreted prudentially.
- Defenders of the epistemic OQA need claims like "given all our evidence, theism is unlikely, but it is epistemically reasonable to believe it" to be coherent, which they are not.

## Conclusion
- The epistemic OQA is not convincing, unlike the moral OQA.
- Therefore, analytic reductionism in epistemology is plausible and offers theoretical advantages.
- This poses a challenge for those using moral-epistemic parity to support robust moral realism, as epistemic normativity is not irreducible like moral normativity.






## Section 4: What If the Proposed Analysis of Epistemic Reasonability Is Not Extensionally Adequate?
### Chris Heathwood

1. **Metaethics and Reductionism:**
   - **Reductionism vs. Non-Reductionism:** Reductionism posits that moral facts and properties can be reduced to non-moral, often naturalistic, facts and properties. Non-reductionists argue that moral properties are irreducible and unique.
    >One example of moral facts and properties that can be reduced to non-moral, often naturalistic, facts and properties is the concept of altruism. Altruism is often understood as the selfless concern for the well-being of others. From a reductionist perspective, altruistic behavior can be explained in terms of evolutionary biology and psychology.
   - **Analytic Reductionism:** Focuses on the linguistic and conceptual aspects, asserting that moral properties can be analytically reduced to non-moral terms.
   - **The Open Question Argument:** Challenges analytic reductionism by highlighting that reducing moral properties to natural properties doesn't capture the full meaning of moral terms. The argument suggests that asking whether a natural property implies a moral property always remains an open question, indicating a gap in reductionist theories.
    >For example, if someone claims that goodness is identical to a particular natural property, such as pleasure or happiness, it is still possible to intelligibly ask whether something that possesses that natural property is truly good.


2. **The Epistemic Open Question Argument:**
   - **Analogous Argument:** Like in metaethics, there's a debate about whether epistemic properties (e.g., reasons, justification) can be reduced to non-normative terms.
   - **Sample Analysis:** Examines a potential reduction of epistemic properties to non-normative terms. For instance, defining reasonableness as the likelihood of a claim being true given evidence.
   - **Challenging the Argument:** Contrary to the moral OQA, the epistemic OQA isn't as compelling. The text presents a scenario where someone denies a claim's reasonableness despite acknowledging its likelihood of truth, suggesting conceptual confusion.
    >Sally looking out her window and seeing that the streets are wet. Based on her prior background beliefs and this new piece of information, it is very likely that it recently rained, but not reasonable. 
   - **Interpretive Challenge:** Some attempts to make the denial coherent involve redefining "reasonable" in non-epistemic terms, akin to prudential reasoning.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The epistemic OQA fails to strongly challenge analytic reductionism in epistemology, unlike its moral counterpart.
   - This opens the door to accepting analytic reductionism in epistemology, even though it may disappoint those who sought moral-epistemic parity to support robust moral realism.

# Between Realism and Anti-Realism

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Abstract:** Bueno examines whether Pyrrhonists can adopt realist or anti-realist positions in science, arguing that understanding these as philosophical stances reconciles Pyrrhonism with them. He discusses voluntarism in Pyrrhonism and its implications.
=======
The paper "Between Realism and Anti-Realism" by Marion Vorms, found in *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences*, explores various aspects of the debate between realism and anti-realism in the context of scientific theories and models. Here are some examples used in the paper:
>>>>>>> 0abf6c19f88527c21e6fae6bd5383bd1f73dbd1b

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Introduction:** Pyrrhonism is presented as a method of investigation, involving suspending judgment rather than asserting truth or impossibility of knowledge.
=======
- **Theories and Models:** Vorms discusses how different scientific theories and models can be interpreted through the lenses of realism and anti-realism. Realists argue that theories and models describe real entities and phenomena, while anti-realists view them as useful tools for predicting observations without necessarily describing reality.
>>>>>>> 0abf6c19f88527c21e6fae6bd5383bd1f73dbd1b

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Voluntarism in Pyrrhonism:** The ability to control theoretical beliefs while perceptual beliefs remain involuntary.
=======
- **The Case of Neptune:** An example often discussed in the context of scientific realism is the prediction and subsequent discovery of Neptune. Scientists predicted the existence of Neptune based on irregularities in Uranus's orbit, and its discovery supported the realist claim that scientific theories can describe unobserved entities.
>>>>>>> 0abf6c19f88527c21e6fae6bd5383bd1f73dbd1b

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Conclusion:** Bueno suggests Pyrrhonism can accommodate both realist and anti-realist views within its framework, emphasizing the importance of philosophical stances.
=======
- **Theoretical Entities:** Vorms examines how theoretical entities like electrons or quarks are treated within realism and anti-realism. Realists claim these entities exist independently of our observations, whereas anti-realists might argue they are merely useful constructs for explaining and predicting phenomena.
>>>>>>> 0abf6c19f88527c21e6fae6bd5383bd1f73dbd1b

<<<<<<< HEAD
Bueno discusses Gödel's ideas challenging voluntarism and Pyrrhonists' approach to suspending judgment as a form of voluntary agnosticism. Pyrrhonists suspend judgment on philosophical and scientific views, seeking truth through an investigative stance.

Pyrrhonists neither commit to nor reject scientific realism, structural realism, or semirealism, but seek truth beyond appearances, aligning with realism as an investigative stance. The concept of stance is discussed, highlighting mode of engagement, style of reasoning, and propositional attitudes.

Pyrrhonists can engage with anti-realist views dialectically, questioning commitments while exploring alternatives, maintaining coherence by treating stances as modes of engagement. Understanding scientific practice dynamically allows them to navigate between realist and anti-realist perspectives without wholesale acceptance.








=======
- **The Success of Science:** The "No-miracles" argument is presented, which posits that the success of scientific theories in making accurate predictions would be miraculous if these theories did not accurately describe some aspect of reality. This argument supports scientific realism.

- **Dark Matter:** The discussion includes the example of dark matter, which has not been directly observed but is posited to exist based on gravitational effects that cannot be explained by known matter. This case highlights the debate about whether theoretical entities proposed by scientific theories should be considered real.

These examples illustrate the practical implications of the realism vs. anti-realism debate, particularly how it affects our interpretation of scientific theories and their components.
