# The Positive Argument Against Scientific Realism

Boge, F.J. The Positive Argument Against Scientific Realism. J Gen Philos Sci 54, 535–566 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10838-022-09636-z

The passage discusses significant philosophical arguments concerning scientific realism and anti-realism, particularly focusing on quantum physics. Here are the key points and arguments:

1. **Putnam's No Miracles Argument (1975)**:
   - **Positive Argument for Realism**: Hilary Putnam coined the "no miracles argument," which suggests that the success of science is best explained by the truth (or approximate truth) of its theories. This is a positive argument supporting scientific realism.
   - **Pessimistic Meta-Induction (1978)**: Conversely, Putnam also presented a negative argument suggesting that because many successful scientific theories of the past have been proven false, current successful theories are likely to be false as well. This is known as the pessimistic meta-induction.


>Hilary Whitehall Putnam  (July 31, 1926 – March 13, 2016) was an American philosopher, mathematician, computer scientist, and figure in analytic philosophy in the second half of the 20th century. He contributed to the studies of philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophy of science.[5] Outside philosophy, Putnam contributed to mathematics and computer science. Together with Martin Davis he developed the Davis–Putnam algorithm for the Boolean satisfiability problem[6] and he helped demonstrate the unsolvability of Hilbert's tenth problem.(Wikipedia)


2. **Constructive Empiricism (van Fraassen, 1980)**:
   - **Observable vs. Unobservable Distinction**: Bas van Fraassen's constructive empiricism posits that science aims not at true theories but at theories that are empirically adequate. A key element of this view is the distinction between observables (which can be directly observed) and unobservables (which cannot).
   - **Vagueness of Observability**: Critics, like Maxwell (1962), argue that the line between observation and theory is arbitrary and lacks clear criteria, challenging the foundational basis of van Fraassen's distinction.

3. **Quantum Physics and Anti-Realism**:
   - **Quantum Physics as a Challenge to Realism**: The success of quantum physics (QP) might suggest that scientific realism is not an appropriate philosophical stance. This idea stems from the fact that quantum mechanics does not rely on classical realistic presuppositions and has led to reconsiderations of the nature of scientific explanation and observation.
   - **Van Fraassen’s Influence**: Van Fraassen has been influenced by quantum theory in shaping his anti-realist stance, arguing that QP challenges the idea that physics must explain how appearances are produced in reality.


>Bastiaan Cornelis van Fraassen (born 1941) is a Dutch-American philosopher noted for his contributions to philosophy of science, epistemology and formal logic. He is best known for his work on free logic and his introduction of the supervaluation semantics


4. **Argument from Quantum Physics Against Realism**:
   - The passage suggests that there is an implicit argument against scientific realism based on the success of quantum physics, though it has not been explicitly stated or defended in the philosophical literature. This argument could show that because quantum mechanics does not adhere to realistic presuppositions yet remains highly successful, the case for realism is weakened.
   - **Wallace's Distinction (2020)**: It is important to distinguish between "quantum theory" as a formal framework and "quantum physics" as its concrete applications. The argument against realism is more nuanced than simply denying the existence of atoms; it concerns the deeper implications of how our most predictive theories work without relying on realism.

>David Wallace is a contemporary philosopher who is interested in the Everett interpretation of quantum theory (often called the "Many-Worlds Interpretation"), quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics, general relativity, symmetry and gauge theory.

The text outlines the background and context for an argument that uses the success of quantum physics to challenge scientific realism. It highlights the nuanced debate between realism and anti-realism, particularly how quantum mechanics complicates traditional realist interpretations of scientific theories.
