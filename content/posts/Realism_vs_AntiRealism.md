All reality is filtered through human senses and cognition, meaning that everything we experience—observations, facts, data, or even the act of holding an object—is not reality itself but merely our perception of it. Immanuel Kant wrote about this idea in *Critique of Pure Reason* (1791)[^1], where he introduced the concept of [Transcendental Idealism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-transcendental-idealism/). He argued that we can only perceive the world as it appears to us as phenomena and never access the true nature of objects, which he referred to as the “thing-in-itself” or noumenon.
