# Psychedelics like ayahuasca change the brain

**Ayahuasca** is a brew or tea consumed in South America consisting of the vine _Banisteriopsis caapi_ and the shrub _Psychotria viridis_ that causes hallucinations. 

The active ingredient that causes the psychedelic experience is N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is a structural analog of tryptamine, which activates 5-HT4 receptors. Also, DMT has to be consumed with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) to prevent the metabolism of DMT. 

Ayahuasca stimulate neurotrophic (peptides or small proteins that support neurons) and transcription factors associated with synaptic plasticity (the strengthening or weakening of synapses).
